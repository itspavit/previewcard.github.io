## Overview
This is my solution to making a responsive card using flexbox mainly. I have learned alot of new things in this project especially how to use flex direction, using mix-blend-mode to give the child container a color from its parent. Overall i am satisfied with the outcome. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started by thinking about how i should write my HTML. After i was convinced with the HTML i started styling the card using CSS. After all the basic styling was done. I used flexbox to align the card to the center of the page and added media query for desktop. Lastly i added blend mode for the image. Finally made some small changes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned alot especially to not be afraid of making mistakes and experimenting. 

Here is some code i am proud of i will use the mix blend mode in future as well.

.header picture img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.9;
}

### Continued development

In future i will try using grid for this if time allows.
